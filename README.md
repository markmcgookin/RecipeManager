# RecipeManager

Repo for the iOS App Recipe Manager

This is a very basic iOS application that allows users to add recipes (or any other notes for that matter) to a collection. This collection will be synchronised to iCloud and will cascade to any other device running the application with the same iCloud ID.

The app is universal and works on both iPhone and iPad.
